Soundcards:
A soundcard converts digital signal into an analog signal, which then travels through the 
speakers or headphones. It converts analog signal from a mic to digital for it to be then 
processes by the OS. 

Drivers:
Drivers such as OSS and ALSA are used to interact with soundcards. ALSA supports USB soundcards,
PCI soundcards, and onboard audio. Many applications support working with ALSA directly, though
that is often not the case due to sound servers. ALSA by itself is unable to multiplex, turn
multiple inputs into a single output, properly.

Sound servers:
Sound servers such as JACK and PulseAudio are the bridge between the client program and the sound
driver. The audio mixing is done by the sound servers.

Program (client) -> Pulseaudio (server) -> ALSA (driver) -> sound card (hardware)

JACK supports MIDI and is way more flexible than Pulseaudio, though more complex as well.
Pipewire seeks to become a replacement for both JACK and ALSA.
