Soundcards:
A soundcard converts digital signal into an analog signal, which then travels through the 
speakers or headphones. It converts analog signal from a mic to digital for it to be then 
processes by the OS. 

Drivers:
Drivers such as OSS and ALSA are used to interact with soundcards. ALSA supports USB soundcards,
PCI soundcards, and onboard audio. Many applications support working with ALSA directly, though
that is often not the case due to sound servers. ALSA by itself is unable to multiplex, turn
multiple inputs into a single output, properly.

Sound servers:
Sound servers such as JACK and PulseAudio are the bridge between the client program and the
sound driver. The audio mixing is done by the sound servers.

Program (client) -> Pulseaudio (server) -> ALSA (driver) -> sound card (hardware)

JACK supports MIDI and is way more flexible than Pulseaudio, though more complex as well.
Pipewire seeks to become a replacement for both JACK and ALSA. JACK should be used when 
audio work such as mixing, producing, or recording is done. Pulseaudio should be used when
regular computing such as watching videos, listening to music, etc. is done.

Pulseaudio:
Pulseaudio doesn't need much configuration. Simply start the daemon with `pulseaudio -D'
on startup, kill it when neccessary with `pulseaudio -k`. See the logs with `sudo pulseaudio
-v`. `pamixer` is great CLI tool and `pavucontrol` is a great GUI tool for twearking 
pulseaudio controls. 

JACK:
JACK usually requires more attention and configuration then pulseaudio. Before starting the
JACK server with `qjackctl`, a GUI JACK controller, kill all audio applications and the 
pulseaudio daemon.
