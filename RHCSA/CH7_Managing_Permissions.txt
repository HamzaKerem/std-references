When determining owner of the file, the shell first checks if the user is
the owner, then the group, then if access was granted through ACLs, then
lastly assumes other's permissions apply.

`find ~ -user linda` or `find ~ -group josh` to search for files that belong
to users or groups. `chgrp` can be used to change group ownership

`groups user` will display the primary group of the user first. Use `newgrp`
to temporarily change one's primary group; this will start a subshell with 
the change applied.

dir permissions: 
read: list files
write: create new files
execute: cd into dir and read files in dir

chmod relative mode:
chmod [u|g|o|a]+|-perm FILE # where perm is r|w|x and a is all

chmod -R a+X DIR/ # applies executable permissions to subdirs but not files
