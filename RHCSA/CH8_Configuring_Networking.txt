ipv4 addresses are 32-bit addresses
ipv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses

private IPs:
10.0.0.0/8 (a single Class A network)
172.16.0.0/12 (16 Class B networks)
192.168.0.0/16 (256 Class C networks)

Network Address Translation (NAT) is commonly used
on the router that connects the private network to the Internet. In NAT, the nodes use a private IP address, but when accessing the Internet, this private IP address is replaced with the IP address of the NAT router. The NAT router in its turn uses tables to keep track of all connections that currently exist for the hosts in the network. Based on this table, the NAT router helps make it possible for computers with a private IP address to connect to hosts on the Internet anyway.

In ipv6 range of zeros (and leading zero) can be emitted:
02fb:0000:0000:0000:90ff:fe23:8998:1234 -> 2fb::90ff:fe23:8998:1234

Subnet Masks:
To know to which network a computer belongs, a subnet mask is used with every
IP address. The subnet mask defines which part of the network address indicates
the network and which part indicates the node. Subnet masks may be written in
the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, which indicates the num-
ber of bits in the subnet mask, or in the classical notation, and they always need
to be specified with the network address. Examples include 192.168.10.100/24
(CIDR notation), which indicates that a 24-bit network address is used, and
192.168.10.100/255.255.255.0 (classical notation), which indicates exactly the same.
