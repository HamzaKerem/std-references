ipv4 addresses are 32-bit addresses
ipv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses

private IPs:
10.0.0.0/8 (a single Class A network)
172.16.0.0/12 (16 Class B networks)
192.168.0.0/16 (256 Class C networks)

Network Address Translation (NAT) is commonly used
on the router that connects the private network to the Internet. In NAT, the nodes use a private IP address, but when accessing the Internet, this private IP address is replaced with the IP address of the NAT router. The NAT router in its turn uses tables to keep track of all connections that currently exist for the hosts in the network. Based on this table, the NAT router helps make it possible for computers with a private IP address to connect to hosts on the Internet anyway.

In ipv6 range of zeros (and leading zero) can be emitted:
02fb:0000:0000:0000:90ff:fe23:8998:1234 -> 2fb::90ff:fe23:8998:1234

Subnet Masks:
To know to which network a computer belongs, a subnet mask is used with every
IP address. The subnet mask defines which part of the network address indicates
the network and which part indicates the node. Subnet masks may be written in
the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, which indicates the number
of bits in the subnet mask, or in the classical notation, and they always need
to be specified with the network address. Examples include 192.168.10.100/24
(CIDR notation), which indicates that a 24-bit network address is used, and
192.168.10.100/255.255.255.0 (classical notation), which indicates exactly the same.

Our full address: 192.168.10.100/24
192.168.10 -> network part
100 -> host part
192.168.10.0 -> network address
192.168.10.255 -> broadcast address

Each network card
also has a 12-byte MAC address. MAC addresses are for use on the local network
(that is, the local physical network or local WLAN, just up to the first router that is
encountered); they cannot be used for communications between nodes that are on
different networks. MAC addresses are important, though, because they help com-
puters find the specific network card that an IP address belongs to.
An example of a MAC address is 00:0c:29:7d:9b:17.
The first 6 bytes is the vendor ID, and the second 6 bytes is the
unique node ID. Vendor IDs are registered, and by using registered vendor IDs, it is
possible to allocate unique MAC addresses.

Tools
ip addr # monitor & configure addresses
ip route # monitor & configure routing
ip link # monitor & configure routing
# use -s to also display statistics

The loopback interface is used for communication between processes. Some processes use the IP 
protocol for internal communications. Every interface automatically gets an IPv6 address, 
which can be used for communication on the local network only.

sudo ip -s link show: shows net cons + network packet statistics

# show default router, aka default gateway, of network:
$ ip route show

Changes made via `ip` are non-persistent, for persisting changes use
`nmcli|nmtui`. `nm-connection-editor` has a GUI interface but is more limited.

nmcli dev show DEVICE # show settings for a device

See man pages `nm-settings` and `nmcli-examples`

Configuration files are stored under /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections

Hostname resolution allows for hosts to contact each other based on hostname.
`hostnamectl hostname HOSTNAME` to change hostname (or you can edit
/etc/hostname or use nmtui). If DNS is configured use FQDN (server1.example.com)
to refer to a device and set hostname as the FQDN.

/etc/resolv.conf is used for DNS resolving but do not modify this file since the
file is managed by Network Manager and the file contents are overwritten
everytime NetworkManager restarts. 

getent hosts HOSTNAME # verify hostname resolution
