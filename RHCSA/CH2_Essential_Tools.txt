When you run the ls -l command, the second field in the output represents the
number of hard links to the file or directory. It tells you how many directory
entries refer to the file. For regular files, this number is typically 1 unless
there are additional hard links created to the file. For directories, this
number is at least 2 (one for the directory itself and one for its . entry),
and it increases by one for each subdirectory contained within it due to their
.. entry.

ln TARGET LINK # create hard link LINK
ln -t DIR TARGET # create hard link to TARGET in DIR

ls -ltr # will list from oldest to newest, -t time -r reverse

# redirect stdout & stderr to file:
cmd > file 2>&1 
# equivilant to:
cmd &> file

< # stdin
<0 # stdin
1> # stdout
2> # stderr

The command `history -c` clears the entire in-memory history of commands,
meaning it deletes all the commands you've run in the current session, not just
the one you want to remove, such as a command containing a password.

If you want to delete a specific command from your history, use the command
`history -d <number>`, where <number> is the line number of the command you
want to delete. You can find this number by typing history, which will list all
your previous commands with their corresponding numbers.

If you want to quickly re-run a command from your history, you can type !
followed by the first few letters of that command. The terminal will then
execute the most recent command that starts with those letters.

- The /etc/motd file contains messages that are displayed after user login on a
terminal session. 
- If you want to show a message before users log in, edit the /etc/issue file. 
- /etc/profile is processed by all users upon login
- You want to set a local variable that will be available for every user in
every shell: use /etc/bashrc. this file is processed when subshells are
started
- /etc/profile.d/ : scripts stored in this dir are sourced by /etc/profile
- ~/.bashrc: user specific login shell variables, functions, aliases, etc.

The man -k command uses a database to find the keywords you are looking for. On
RHEL 9, this database is updated with the mandb command. On older versions of
RHEL (prior to RHEL 7), the makewhatis command was used instead. Also keep in
mind the /usr/share/doc dir.
