When you run the ls -l command, the second field in the output represents the
number of hard links to the file or directory. It tells you how many directory
entries refer to the file. For regular files, this number is typically 1 unless
there are additional hard links created to the file. For directories, this
number is at least 2 (one for the directory itself and one for its . entry),
and it increases by one for each subdirectory contained within it due to their
.. entry.

ln TARGET LINK # create hard link LINK
ln -t DIR TARGET # create hard link to TARGET in DIR

ls -ltr # will list from oldest to newest, -t time -r reverse

cmd > file 2>&1 # redirect stdout & stderr to file
equivilant to cmd &> file
< aka 0<: stdin
1>: stdout
2>: stderr

The command `history -c` removes the in-memory state from the history file of
current history. That doesnâ€™t just remove the line that contains the password,
but everything. Use history -d <number> to remove a line with a specific
number. Type ! followed by the first letters in the command to execute that
cmd from history.

  terminal session. 
- If you want to show a message before users log in, edit the /etc/issue file. 
- /etc/profile is processed by all users upon login
- You want to set a local variable that will be available for every user in
  every shell: use /etc/bashrc. this file is processed when subshells are
started
- ~/.bashrc: user specific login shell variables, functions, aliases, etc.

The man -k command uses a database to find the keywords you are looking for. On
RHEL 9, this database is updated with the mandb command. On older versions of
RHEL (prior to RHEL 7), the makewhatis command was used instead. Also keep in
mind the /usr/share/doc dir.
