Rebooting a Linux server is an important task on the RHCSA exam. Everything
you have configured should still be working after the server has rebooted.  So,

critical modifications to the server configuration. If your server cannot
reboot anymore after applying critical modifications to your serverâ€™s
configuration, at least you know where to look to fix the issues.

you need to be able to use SGID to create a shared group directory!
