By default, the sort command sorts in byte order, which is the order in which the
characters appear in the ASCII text table, not alphabetical order.
-r: reverse, -n: numeric
sort -k 3 -t : /etc/passwd # sort 3rd field, delimeted by ':'
ps aux | sort -nk 4 # sort 4th field, tab delimeted

regex:
'^ann[ae]$'
.: one specific character
*: zero or more
?: zero or one
+: one or more (Extended)
'CHAR{NUM}': NUM instances of CHAR (Extended)
'CHAR{MIN,MAX}': MIN to MAX instances of CHAR (Extended)

Extended set of regex differs from the base set (thus use -E).
`grep -v` shows only lines that do not contain the regular expression.
`grep -v -e '^#' -e '^$'/etc/services` exclude all lines that are empty or
start with '#'. -e is used for searching multiple regex patterns.
