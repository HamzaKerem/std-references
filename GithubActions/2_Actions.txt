An action is a custom application that performs a typically complex 
frequently repeated task. In GH marketplace you can browse for different
Actions (for free).

You can check for pre-installed sofware (which you can run) on the
GH-hosted runners.

GitHub Runner VMs are the underlying compute resources that GitHub Actions uses to run workflows. These runners can execute your jobs in a GitHub Actions workflow, allowing you to automate processes like building, testing, and deploying your code.
jobs in a workflow typically run on separate runner machines unless you explicitly configure them to share a runner.
