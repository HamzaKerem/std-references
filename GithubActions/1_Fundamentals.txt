Workflows are attached to github repos.
Workflows contain Jobs which contain Steps.
you can have as many Workflows (that contain as many Jobs) as you need.

Workflow are triggered upon Events.
Jobs define a Runner, which is an execution environment.
Jobs in a given Workflow run in parallel by default but can be configured to
run sequentially.

a Step corresponds to a shell command to execute or an Action

REPO/.github/workflows/first-action.yml:
name: First Workflow
on: workflow_dispatch # requires manual triggering
jobs: 
  first-job: # identifier determined by user, i.e. second-job, my-job..
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # hosted virtual machines to run workflows on
    steps:
      - name: Print greeting
        run: echo "Hello!!"
      - name: Print goodbye
        run: echo "DONE. bye!!"



GH action files are a part of the code and can be found within the repo.
Once workflows are added, the "Actions" tab on GH will show past workflow  
runs and our identified workflows.

Workflows have steps:
Set up job
Print greeting # user defined
Print goodbye # user defined
Complete job

Running Multi-Line Shell Commands:
...
run: |
    echo "First output"
    echo "Second output"
