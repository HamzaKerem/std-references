Templates, Endpoints, & Pods in Runpod

Templates are pre-configured setups / environments that engineers can deploy. It
simplifies the initilization of GPU instance by preloading software, libraries,
& dependencies. The chosen template (i.e. TensorFlow, PyTorch, Stable Diffusion)
determines the software stack and configuration on the GPU instance.

  For example, if a developer wants to fine-tune a language model on a GPU
  he can select a RunPod template with pre-installed ML libraries to save setup time.

Endpoints are public or private access points (URL or IP address) that
allow external systems to interact with a running GPU instance on RunPod.
Endpoints allow engineers to to expose APIs or services running on the GPU
instance.
