RunPod: Cloud GPU Iaas for running AI & ML models in a scalable, efficient, &
cost-effective manner.

Firestore: A scalable, serverless NoSQL DATABASE offered by Google. Is a Baas
(Backend as a Service) designed for real-time data synchronization and offile
access in mobile & web apps.

Firebase: BaaS PLATFORM that provides a suite of tools and services for
building, managing, & scaling applications.

Firestore is a key part of the Firebase & integrates seamlessly w/ other
Firebase services.

"Serverless" is when the underlying server infrastructure is abstracted away
from the engineer/developer. For instance, RunPod provides access to GPU
resources w/o the engineer having to do any physical or virtual server
administration. Same goes for BaaS; the servers hosting the backend are not
important. However, the serverless approach is less powerful and flexible since
it offers less control of the entire system.
