Great job! Problem 1: The dollar formatted amount the dollar sign ought to have been placed in the returned string. Overall: As a general
rule of thumb, you should have 1 header file per cpp file.

GP3:
Great job! Well thought out solution; the program does not display repeat letters in the letter board, and the program checks for incorrect
number of letters entered and asks the user to try again. Great job catching those edge cases. One small bug: If the word is yucca, and I
type in yuuca, the score is 5, but since I didn't get the letters all right, the score should not be 5, but 4.

PS2:
Well done. Problem 2: Your program does not have it as 2 decimal places after the dot. To solve this problem, you can use fixed.

GP2:
Your program does not account for repeated letters, meaning the user could enter a wrong letter and get one incorrect guess, then they could
enter that same wrong letter again and get another incorrect guess, which you want to avoid. Good modularity.

PS1:
Well done. The code was very clear and easy to read.  Problem 3: Since the prices of items don't change, instead of using literals (a
number) use constants (const). Also, please leave a block comment above each function in the future.  Fantastic job!

GP1:
Well done. Your code is very clear and concise, and both of the games work well. Please put a block comment above each function.
