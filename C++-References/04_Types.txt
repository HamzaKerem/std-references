auto x = 10;
auto y = 3.4f; // declares y to be float, if left out would've been declared double

The string class is a part of the STL.

#include <string>
...
string s = "abcd";
string s2 = s; // does NOT create a pointer to string s

A stream can be tought of pipes which data flows through. It is a buffer.
Items entering the stream will be buffered until removed/extracted.
cin.ignore(n) will remove n characters from the stream.

get() - can get one or more chars from the stream
getline() - gets a line 

get line C++ way:
string s;
getline (cin, s); 

get line C way:
char s[20];
cin.getline (s, 20);

Global vs local variable:
int a;
void main ()
{
	a = 10; // assigns 10 to global a
	int a; // defines local a
	cin >> ::a; // reads value and assigns it to local a, indicated by the '::a' 
}
