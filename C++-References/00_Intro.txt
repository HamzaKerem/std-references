- C++ is a superset of C
- C++ was developed by Stroustrup.
- The Standard Template Library (STL) provides constructs that address common programming data structures and files.

4 Programming trade offs that C++ finds a middle ground in:
- Performance
- Development time
- Executable size
- Portability

Executable Flow:
0. Source code
1. Preprocessor
- Reads # directives 
- Produces processed files by combining source and header files
2. Compiler
- Works on single files
- Produces object file
3. Linker
- Links together multiple object files and library files
- Produces an executable
