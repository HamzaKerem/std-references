A vector<T> is a member of the STL. It creates a list of items of type T, which can grow and shrink as needed.
It is a class, not an intristic construct of C++.

Initialize:
vector<int> v; // empty
vector<int> v (SIZE); // start with 10 elements, appended elements will indexed at SIZE + n
vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3}; // initialize with values

Access an element:
v[3] = 10;

Get size:
v.size ()

Append element:
v.push_back (myInt);

Delete last element:
v.pop_back ();

Remove an element:
v.erease (v.begin() + INDEX);

Iteration for loop:
for (Item myItem : myItemList)
	cout << myItem << endl;
for (char ch : str)
	cout << ch << str;	
Note: The last iteration ch is assigned '\0'

the auto keyword determines the data-type of the variables:
auto i = 100; // i is determined to be an integer

Partial initializer list:
int arr[3] = {1, 2}; // Elements are 1, 2, 0
int arr[3] = {}; // Elements are 0, 0, 0
