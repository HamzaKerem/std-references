Using a string as a stream:
// >>: read from stream, <<: write to stream
ostringstream s1;
s1 << stuff;

Files:
Opening a file:
#include <fstream>
...
ifstream inFile ("file.txt"); // open for reading
ofstream outFile ("file.txt"); // open for writing
// OR
ifsfream inFile; 
inFile.open ("file.txt"); 
inFile.open ("file.txt", ios::out | ios::trunc); // open file with modes

Checking for errors:
if (inFile.fail ())
	cout << "Failed to open file\n";

Close file:
inFile.close ();

Get characters from a file:
char c;
ifstream inFile ("file.txt"); 
while (!inFile.eof ())
	inFile.get (c);

Unformatted output:
cout.put ('A');

Write to file:
outFile << "Lmao test123";
