Nmap scripts are written in lua. Scripts can be found in /usr/share/nmap/scripts.
Running scripts are "noisy"; can be a lot easier more easier to detect than
simple port scans. 

Scripts are grouped under categories such as default, vulnerability,
authentication, safe..

sudo nmap --script-updatedb # update script db

Default scripts:
"Default" scripts are a set of scripts selected by the developers to be ran by
default when options such as `-sC` and `-A` are used.

nmap --script default HOST # run all default scripts
nmap --script "http-*" HOST # run all scripts that match the wildcard

 Many network services, such as web servers, FTP servers, or SSH services,
 display a banner upon connection (i.e. SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.9), which contains details about the service, such as its software version and configuration. NSE scripts like banner are used to capture and report this information.
