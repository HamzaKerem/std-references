In TCP there is a total of 65535 ports.

-p PORT_RANGE # i.e 22 | 22-24 | - (1-65535)
--exclude-ports PORT_RANGE
-F # first 100 ports

Attempt to keep scans limited to a smaller range of ports to avoid detection.
`-sU` (requires root priv) will do a UDP scan instead of the default TCP scan.

Top nmap commands:
-sn # ping scan
--top-ports 20 # check for most common 20 ports
-O # OS scan (different OSes have different TCP stacks)
-A # "all" scan (OS scan, port scan, fingerprinting, etc.)
-p # simple port scan
