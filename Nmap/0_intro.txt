By default, Nmap scans the 1,000 most common TCP ports when no specific ports are specified.

When you send a TCP SYN packet to a server and the targeted port is closed, the server will typically respond with a TCP RST (Reset) packet.

nmap 192.168.1.0-20 # scan from address 0 to 20 within that subnet
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 # scan entire subnet
